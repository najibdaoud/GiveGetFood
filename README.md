# GiveGetFood

This is a web application that enables restaurants, venues, and other event centers to easily donate their excess food to local food banks, pantries, and other groups in need of food. This app was built using React.js and Firebase.

Included in this repository is a video demonstrating how the app works and a PDF illustrating the general user flow for this app.
